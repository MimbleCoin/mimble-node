The Mimble network launch date is not defined yet! 

This roadmap will show you where Mimble plans to invest development ressources in and open steps until Launch. If you are a skilled developer then please jump in and help make it happen!


To be done: (If you want to help please contact us in discord.)
- Organise Community Seednodes (Preferably refferencing IP's)
- Releasing a Git-based Webpage
- Releasing a Git-based Explorer
- Launch of Mainnet
- QT Wallet migration
- Dropping MQS Support entierly 
- Releasing a Git-based Documentation section on the Webpage
- Release Atomic Swap support.
- Release mobile. 
- Additional Grin rebases (if applicable).
- Website content & Design. 
- BTC/MIMBLE atomic swaps.
  - QT wallet integration.
  - MIMBLE 713 integration.
- Decentralized exchange.
- Mobile wallet.
- Multisig.
- Coin shuffle.
- Hardware wallets are unlikely as they require Hardware support. (And it's unclear yet how exactly mimblewimble based coins are supposed to be integrated into a Hardware based Ledger, due to the differences of the protocol) 

There are many potential places development resources can be allocated. They will be chosen based on market needs. Highest priority will be given to requests that primarily benefit and come from the buyers and hodlers of last resort.


By around November 2022 Mimble will switch to C31 completely, further hardforks are not planned yet.
