# Mimble Coin

Mimble Coin is an in-progress implementation of the MimbleWimble protocol. Mostly differentiated by it's codebase Grin by a fixxed Supplycap. <br>
Furthermore this Fork is a proactive measure to keep all the hard work of the MWCÂ Devs alive even if their stream of funding fails. We hold deep respect for all contributors upstream of our Codebase, and feel like code is the correct way to express opinions! <br>Many characteristics are still undefined but the following constitutes a first set of choices:

  * Clean and minimal implementation, and aiming to stay as such.
  * Follows the Mimblewimble protocol, which provides hidden amounts and scaling advantages.
  * Cuckoo Cycle proof of work in two variants named Cuckaroo (ASIC-resistant) and Cuckatoo (ASIC-targeted).
  * Relatively fast block time: one minute.
  * Fixed block reward over time with a decreasing dilution.
  * Transaction fees are based on the number of Outputs created/destroyed and total transaction size.
  * Smooth curve for difficulty adjustments.
